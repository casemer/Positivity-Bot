# Positivity-Bot
A Bot made for the discord server for my floor as a CA

This bot can be adjusted to work for any server. It provides you with a few commands

!help - tells you the other commands
!encourage - gives you a random sentence of something uplifting/motivational 
!wholesome - scrubs the front page of reddit's r/wholesome meme page and puts it in the chat
!resources - this one is specific to Plymouth State and will delete your message (to remain private) then send a private message to the person providiing information on campus to get help
